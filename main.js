// Basic Game 
// Generate AI HTML, CSS and JS code for Rock Paper Scissors game üçè 
// Paste into the correct files üçè 
// Does the game work? üçè 
    // - HTML and CSS linked to show a themed static page, JS functions üçè 

// This is the code generated by ChatGPT in response to request - 
// please may I have the javascript for the HTML above?

// TASK - COMMENT ONE THE CODE
/* Now spend time reading through the code line by line, and write your own comments after each line to help break down and explain what each line is doing. 
// Reading and understanding existing code is a key skill for developers, so take your time to fully understand how it works. 
//If there's something you don't recognize or understand, you can ask ChatGPT to explain that part specifically, or you can Google.

  - Identify the JavaScript fundamentals we've covered in the course so far. How is the code using variables, arrays, objects, functions, etc.?
  - Identify how the code interacts with and manipulates the DOM. How does it use the methods we've learned already? Are there any methods it uses that we didn't cover in class? If so, Google them!
  - Is there anything you would change about the code generated?
  - Is there any bit hard to read that you would rewrite to be clearer?
  - Is there any functionality you'd like to add?
  - Would you style it differently? */

// the result is a decimal number between 0 (inclusive) and 3 (exclusive)

// nb. when the computerPlay function is called, it returns a random choice for the computer to play in the game. 
// This choice is later used in the game logic to determine the outcome of each round.
